\chapter{Introduction} 

Our aim is to implement multiple search algorithms, and compare them with themselves and with the ones that were already discussed: A*, DFS, BFS, UCS.

We chose the following searching strategies:

\paragraph{Uninformed}

\begin{itemize}

\item Bidirectional Search

\item Depth Limited Search

\item Iterative Deepening Depth-First Search

\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Informed}

\begin{itemize}

\item Iterative Deepening A*

\item Recursive Best-First Search

\end{itemize}
