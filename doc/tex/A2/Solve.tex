\section{Solving logic puzzles programatically}
\label{sec:solve}

The advantage of translating propositions into a system of equations in the ring form is that it can be solved by using only algebra. Thus a range of mathematical tools can be used for finding a solution, having the following characteristics:

\begin{itemize}
\item Can do symbolic computation
\item Can solve multi-variable equations
\item Can work with values from the Boolean ring
\begin{itemize}
 \item Can simplify $x^2$ to $x$ and $x + x$ to $0$
 \item Can solve equations with variables from this domain
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

Such tool could be Mathematica. Mace4 is also a good tool for solving this kind of equations, however it has a flaw, presented in \ref{sec:mace4_flaw}, which requires in some cases to wrap the expressions in ``mod 2''. We used Mace4 for verifying the correctness of our solutions.

Practically if we multiply all the expressions together, according to the equation \ref{eq:one_eq}, we could have a single multi-variable equation, which can be solved by these tools, thus solving the logic puzzle via algebra.
