\section{Introduction}

The purpose of this chapter is to discuss the usage of modular arithmetics (Boolean rings) for solving logic puzzles, as represented in \cite{Ciraulo2020algebra}.  

The theory is applied in solving the ``The Lady or the Tiger'' puzzles \cite{Smullyan1992}.

Also a program was written in python for translating a Mace4 input file from propositional logic to modular arithmetics, producing algebraic expressions on the Boolean ring. The output can be supplied as input for Mace4 \cite{Mace4Manual}.
