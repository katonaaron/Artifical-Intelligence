\section{Translating propositional logic to modular arithmetic programatically}

Our purpose was not to write a solver for the equations in the ring form. Instead, a translator program was written in Python which converts Mace4 input files from propositional logic to modular arithmetic.

For this purpose, the \textbf{SymPy} library was used which provides symbolic computation capabilities in Python. However it has some limitations: 

\begin{itemize}
\item Does not simplify $x^2$ to $x$ automatically. Solved by modifying the expression tree.
\item We could not find any possibility for achieving all the capabilities from \ref{sec:solve} at the same time, i.e. solving multi-variable equation on the Boolean ring.
\end{itemize}
