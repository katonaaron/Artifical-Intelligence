The purpose of this chapter is to present the problem of cats and mice which can be solved using planning. Furthermore, descriptions of the domains and problems are presented, with gradually increasing complexity.

The "Fast Downward" planner was used for verifying the correct behavior of the description. It is assumed that the executable file is pointed by the PATH variable, and that it is called \verb|fd|.
